  <h1>Possible Activities</h1>

  <h2>Boundary Water Canoe Trip</h2>
  <p>In recent years some students and other members may have seen a lack in the Boundary Water Canoe Trip. One of "The greatest wilderness experiences offered".
    Unfortunatley, the trip has been canceled for all. But, have no fear. If you are interested you should check out ecology club and in the future there could be more trips.</p>
  <p>An experience unlike any other! Campers will have so many new experiences that allow them to truly be in the moment. For some, not having any technology in sight might not be how they
    want to spend a whole week in the middle of nowhere. But, There are many things to offer on this trip such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Canoeing </li>
    <li> Swimming </li>
    <li> Hiking </li>
    <li> Bird Watching </li>
    <li> Fishing </li>
    <li> etc. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
  <p>Before the REAL fun can begin, there are some rules and requirments members have to take part in. These rules and requirements are ONLY there
    to make sure members are safe and having the best time they could possibly have.</p>
<p> First, there is ABSOLUTLEY no technology on this trip. This is so members can experience the wilderness in all of its glory.</p>
<p> Second, members are not to join other groups to create a large group (nine or more at a time).</p>
<p> Third, any and all soap can not be used in the water even if it is biodegradable. Soap needs soil to be biodegradable. We are here to appreciate
  nature, not destroy it.</p>

<h2>Outdoor Classroom</h2>
<p>A place where your brain can restore and refresh from the normal school day. An outdoor classroom anyone can use as long as the teacher requests it.
  Technology is not as heavy so students AND teachers can experience something a little different and conncet with nature one on one.</p>
  <p>A great oppotunity, but, it was almost something students and teachers were not able to experience anymore. No need to worry! A great fundraiser (see home for mpre details)
    earned enough money for this amazing outdoor classroom to improve the experience for all!</p>
